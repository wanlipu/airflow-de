# Project - Data Pipelines with Airflow

## Project Context and Purpose
A music streaming company, Sparkify, has decided that it is time to introduce more automation and monitoring to their data warehouse ETL pipelines and come to the conclusion that the best tool to achieve this is Apache Airflow.

They have decided to bring you into the project and expect you to create high grade data pipelines that are dynamic and built from reusable tasks, can be monitored, and allow easy backfills. They have also noted that the data quality plays a big part when analyses are executed on top the data warehouse and want to run tests against their datasets after the ETL steps have been executed to catch any discrepancies in the datasets.

The source data resides in S3 and needs to be processed in Sparkify's data warehouse in Amazon Redshift. The source datasets consist of JSON logs that tell about user activity in the application and JSON metadata about the songs the users listen to.


## Project Description
In this project, I will apply Apache Airflow and data pipelines to build an ETL pipeline. To complete the project, I will need to load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Apache Airflow, and load them back into S3.


## Dataset
### Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the [Million Song Dataset](http://millionsongdataset.com/). Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
```
song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json
```
And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
```json
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this [event simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim) based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset
```
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
```
And below is an example of what part of a single log file, 2018-11-01-events.json, looks like.
```json
{"artist":"Black Eyed Peas","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Sylvie","gender":"F","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Cruz","length":214.93506,"level":"free","location":"Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1540266185796.0,"sessionId":9,"song":"Pump It","status":200,"ts":1541108520796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.77.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version\/7.0.5 Safari\/537.77.4\"","userId":"10"}

## Run Project Locally
- Install Airflow, create variable AIRFLOW_HOME and AIRFLOW_CONFIG with the appropiate paths, and place dags and plugins on airflor_home directory.
  - `export AIRFLOW_HOME=~/airflow`
  - `pip install apache-airflow`
  - `pip install postgres`
  - `pip install gunicorn`
  - `airflow version` to check package version
- Initialize Airflow data base with `airflow initdb`, and open webserver with `airflow webserver`
  - `airflow initdb` to initialize database
  - `airflow webserver -p 8080` inside of `airflow` folder
- Access the server http://localhost:8080 and create:
